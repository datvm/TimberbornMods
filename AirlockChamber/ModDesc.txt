This mod adds the Airlock Chamber, a "high-tech" structure that blocks water and allows beavers to walk through it.

[h1]Airlock Chamber[/h1]

[i]Reverse-engineered from a submerged vault labeled 'Do Not Open When Wet'.[/i]

- Block water but allow two-way passage.
- Solid (other buildings can be built on its top).
- Cost 1500 Science to unlock, 15 Planks, 15 Resin and 5 Metal Blocks to build.

[h1]6-way Airlock Chamber[/h1]

[i]Schröbeaver principle: path and puddle states collapse only when you peek.[/i]

- Same as Airlock Chamber but allows passage in all 6 directions. You need to build one extra to exit on the same level if you want to go up.
- Cost 2000 Science to unlock, 30 Planks, 30 Resin and 10 Metal Blocks to build.

Both can be built by both the Folktails and Iron Teeths. GreedyBuilders and Emberpelts are supported but not tested, please tell me if it does not work.
