This mod adds the Airlock Chamber, a "high-tech" structure that blocks water and allows beavers to walk through it.

[i]Reverse-engineered from a submerged vault labeled 'Do Not Open When Wet'.[/i]

- Block water but allow two-way passage.
- Solid (other buildings can be built on its top).
- Cost 1500 Science to unlock, 15 Planks and 5 Metal Blocks to build.

Can be built by both the Folktails and Iron Teeths. GreedyBuilders is provided but not tested, please tell me if it does not work.
