Blueprint Relics introduce discoverable ancient artifacts that can be excavated to unlock alternate recipes and permanent production upgrades.

[h1]Short Gameplay Flow (Overview)[/h1]
- Relics periodically spawn on the map and expire if ignored.
- Connect a path to excavate them through step-based excavation.
- Excavation consumes science, time, and [b]goods instantly from district storages[/b] (no workers, no haulers, no delivery jobs). Requirements can be negotiated at intervals.

- When finished, choose one reward or dig deeper to reroll rewards at full cost.

Larger relics unlock rarer recipes and stronger upgrades.
Excavation pauses expiration, but nothing ever resets the timer. You can also accelerate the expiration if it is taking space.

[b]Discover all the fun recipes for yourself![/b] I am not listing them here but there are 30 of them (some of them are specific to Folktails or Iron Teeth only).

[h1]Detailed Mechanics[/h1]
[h2]Relic Spawning and Expiration[/h2]

Every day, the game attempts to spawn a Blueprint Relic (50% chance). This chance is divided by 4 for each existing relic on the map (50% → 12.5% → 3.125%).

If a relic spawns, its size is randomized: 70%, 20% and 10% chance for small, medium and large relics respectively, which will determine:
- Maximum expiration time
- Number of excavation steps
- Required resources.
- Reward rarity and type.

Each relic has a random expiration time based on its size: 10-15, 20-30 and 30-60 days. If you don't like a relic, you can accelerate its expiration at no cost, it will expire in 0.5, 1 and 2 days.

[h2]Excavation Setup[/h2]
Relics must be connected to a district path to begin excavation. Excavation draws resources from district storages directly, without using workers or haulers.
Each step requires:
- Science (deducted directly).
- Time (expiration is paused while excavating).
- Goods, usually grouped into digging materials and food/water for workers.
All required goods for a step [b]must be fully available at once and cannot be accumulated gradually over time[/b].
You can [b]Pause[/b] excavation at any time to stop resource consumption but the expiration timer will continue running.

[h2]Negotiation[/h2]
At any time, you can choose to [b]Negotiate[/b] the requirements for the relic. This will re-randomize the requirements [b]AND[/b] reset all excavation progress. After negotiation, there is a cooldown before you can negotiate again (1/2/3 days based on relic size). Think of it as finding another digging spot. There is no guarantee that the new requirements will be better.

[h2]Rewards[/h2]
After completing all steps, choose one reward:

[h3]Unlock a new recipe[/h3]
Rarity depends on relic size:
- Common recipes usually involve trade-offs.
- Uncommon recipes are alternative paths that are generally the same or a bit better.
- Rare recipes are usually better in all situations.

If you roll an Uncommon recipe but there is no Uncommon recipe left, you will get a Common recipe instead. You cannot get a Rare recipe even if you run out of Uncommon and Common recipes this way. You will however, get something else.

[h3]Special Recipe Upgrades[/h3]
Depending on relic size, there is a chance you can get a special upgrade for an already unlocked recipe:
- Small relics: Capacity upgrade.
- Medium relics: Time reduction.
- Large relics: One random output +1 (it could be extremely good or hilariously bad depending on the recipe). This option is always present.

If you run out of eligible recipes, you always get this special reward present.

[h3]Science Fallback[/h3]

If no recipes remain to unlock, the relic also gives a Science reward option. The amount scales with relic size and is a multiple of the total Science spent: x2, x4 and x6 for small, medium and large relics respectively.

[h3]Dig Deeper (Reward Reroll)[/h3]

If none of the presented rewards are desirable, you may choose Dig Deeper:
- Abandons the current reward options
- [b]Restarts excavation from step 0[/b]
- Uses the same requirements
- Expiration timer is [b]NOT[/b] reset

[h2]View unlocked recipes and upgrades[/h2]

At any time you can press the rebindable hotkey "View Blueprint Relic Upgrades" in UI (default: Ctrl + Shift + U) to see all unlocked recipes and upgrades:
