Give your buildings some style! With Building Decals, you can decorate any building in Timberborn with custom images. Flags, emblems, clan symbols, warning signs, memes - whatever you want!

- Add unlimited decals to any building: Works with any PNG file (supports transparency). You can even add holes or cutouts. Uses 128 PPU (Pixels Per Unit): a 128×128 image matches a 1×1 building, but you can freely scale decals.
- Rotate, scale, and position decals anywhere. You can also Flip and Tint decals.
- Copy & paste decal setups between buildings. Hotkeys: Ctrl+D to copy, Ctrl+Shift+D to paste (configurable in Settings → Keybindings).

Tips:

- Use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3547764728]TImprove 4 UX[/url] for collapsible panels.
- When sliders are tricky, hold Shift and click the number to enter values manually.
- Layer multiple decals for unique effects. You can also use transparency channel for glass effect. This is a good decal for making window glass thanks to Anythin: https://i.imgur.com/dRoPdwi.png

The decals are purely visual and do not affect gameplay.
