LV.BHP.UpdateText,"<b>Stockpile/Storage supply for Renovation is now OPT-OUT</b>
Sorry about the confusion caused by the description on Renovation description. I should have put it higher.
Nevertheless, after the current update, all Storage will supply materials for renovation by default. You need to uncheck it if you want to opt-out instead of opt-in like before.
Again, I want to clarify <b>how material supply for renovation works:</b>
- You do <b>NOT</b> need Builders or Haulers.
- All materials will be taken <b>instantly</b> from any Storage building that has "Supply materials for renovations" checked. It is not taken gradually but at once when all materials are available.",
