Configure how the game's autosave feature works. Someone complained the autosave feature keeps too few saves so I made this one. Also someone requested to keep a save before bad weather warning.

This mod also add [b]a Keybinding/hotkey to trigger autosave immediately[/b], default is Ctrl + S. Note that this trigger an autosave so your save may get overwritten if it gets too old. You can change the keybinding in Settings -> Keybindings -> Trigger auto-save in UI group.

By default, this mod changes the autosave frequency to 5 minutes (from 10 minutes) of real-life time, and keep 5 auto saves (from game default 3). You can configure it in Main menu or in-game menu -> Mods -> Setting button next to the mod's name.

- Enabled: whether [b]this mod's changes[/b] are applied. Autosave feature itself can be toggled in Settings menu.
- Auto-save frequency (real-life minute): How often should auto-save saves. Game default: 10, mod default: 5.
- Auto-save count: How many auto-saves should be kept. Game default: 3, mod default: 5.
- Warn before autosave: show a warning 5s before an autosave is made. Does not work for the "Extra save on weather warning" save.
- Extra save on weather warning: When a weather warning is issued, make an extra save named 'weatherwarning.save' that is only overwritten by the next cycle's warning. This save is not counted towards the save count. Mod default: no.

[b]WARNING:[/b] You can set auto-save frequency to below 1 but be careful your previous autosave may get overwritten because the game autosave uses minute as the file name. This also happen when you use Ctrl + S to trigger an autosave. Basically, within one (real-life) minute, there can only be one autosave at a time.

This mod works independently and can work together with my other mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3418216697]Save Everyday[/url].
