This extension adds full in-game configuration support for the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3601143522]Daisugi Forestry mod[/url].

All Daisugi values can now be adjusted directly from the Mod Settings (Main or Game menu -> Mods -> Settings button next to the mod name):
- Growth times: How many days after mature that trees will give Daisugi Logs
- Log yields: How many logs a tree will give when harvested for Daisugi Logs
- Harvest time: How long (in hours) does it take to harvest a tree for Daisugi Logs. Note that if you put it too long, the beaver may starve as it waits for the job to complete.
- Produces Planks: If enabled, that type of tree will produce planks instead of logs when harvested for Daisugi Logs.

There are three quick difficulty templates to choose from:
- Easy: The original Daisugi values.
- Normal (default when enabling this mod), Oak provides Planks.
- Hard: Much longer growth and harvest times and lower yields but produce Planks.

Note: Daisugi providing Planks is inspired by real-life practices where Daisugi logs are often used for high-quality lumber. Also in-game, it's probably useful [i]most[/i] of the time BUT you lose the flexibility of using Logs for other purposes.

Settings can be changed at any time, but you must reload the save for changes to take effect if adjusted mid-game.
