Another Configurable mod, this time you can configure all the 'fun' buildings! You can configure the Effect points, number of Visitors and Ranges of Wellbeing, Decoration and Monuments buildings.

By default, this mod does nothing. To configure it, go to Main Menu → Mods → Settings (next to the mod name):
- Effect multiplier: Controls how quickly Need points increase for relevant buildings. 1 is the game default. Higher = faster (easier), lower = slower (harder).
- Capacity multiplier and addition: Adjusts how many visitors a building can host simultaneously. Rounded down, minimum 1. Example: ×1.5 and +1 make a Campfire (default 5 spots) have 8 spots.
- Range multiplier and addition: Adjusts the area of effect for relevant buildings. Rounded down, minimum 1. Example: ×1.5 and +1 make a Farmer Monument (default 7 tiles) have an 11-tile range.

Note: affect Wonders too but not the capacity (i.e the workforce required).
