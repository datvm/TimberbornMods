LV.CPl.NoConUpDesc,"Prevents land contamination from being brought up. Enables planting trees or crops on platforms even if the land below is unsuitable.",
LV.CPl.GrowthSect,"Growth options:
- Trees: Log providing plants that are planted by Foresters (e.g. Pine, Oak).
- Crops: Food providing plants that are planted by Farmers <b>and Bushes</b> (e.g. Carrots, Blueberry and Dandelion Bushes).
- Products: Resources growing on trees after they mature (e.g. Pine Resin, Blueberries).",

LV.CPl.ReproducibleChanceMultiplierDesc,"Adjusts the chance for trees to reproduce each hour (default: 1–3% depending on type).
Default: ×1. ×0 disables reproduction. Example: ×2 makes a Pine with a base 3% chance reproduce at 6% chance.",
