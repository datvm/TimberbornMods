Configurable Plants gives you full control over how plants behave in Timberborn. It combines the features of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3396202044]Configurable Growth[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3450786281]Vertical Farming[/url] into a single V1 mod, letting you customize placement rules, growth speeds, yields, and natural reproduction.

To configure the mod: from the game menu (before loading a save) -> Mods -> click the Settings button next to the mod name.

[h2]Placement options[/h2]
- Remove corner occupation: Build structures like Platforms over plants.
- Remove path occupation: Let Paths run through planted tiles.
- Plant without ground: Plant directly on roofs and platforms; irrigation and contamination come from the land below.
--- No contamination up (cheater :P): Stops land contamination from propagating upward, allowing trees and crops to grow on platforms even if the ground beneath is unsuitable.

[h2]Growth and output options[/h2]
- Tree growth rate: Multiplier for how fast trees mature.
- Crop growth rate: Multiplier for crops planted by Farmers and Bushes (Carrots, Blueberries, Dandelions).
- Product growth rate: Multiplier for products that grow on mature trees (Pine Resin, Blueberries).

- Tree output multiplier: Adjust log yield when cutting trees.
- Crop output multiplier: Adjust harvested crop quantities.
- Product output multiplier: Adjust gathered product amounts.

- Reproducible chance multiplier: Adjusts the chance for trees to reproduce each hour (default: 1–3% depending on type). Default: ×1. ×0 disables reproduction. Example: ×2 makes a Pine with a base 3% chance reproduce at 6% chance.
