Configurable Plants gives you full control over how plants behave in Timberborn. It combines the features of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3396202044]Configurable Growth[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3450786281]Vertical Farming[/url] into a single V1 mod, letting you customize placement rules, planting speed, growth speed, output, harvest time, demolishing time, and natural reproduction.

To configure the mod: from the game menu (before loading a save) -> Mods -> click the Settings button next to the mod name.

[h2]Placement options[/h2]
- Remove corner occupation: Build structures like Platforms over plants.
- Remove path occupation: Let Paths run through planted tiles.
- Plant without ground: Plant directly on roofs and platforms; irrigation and contamination come from the land below.
|---- No contamination up (cheater :P): Stops land contamination from propagating upward, allowing trees and crops to grow on platforms even if the ground beneath is unsuitable.

[h2]Growth and output options[/h2]

- Reproducible chance multiplier: Adjusts the chance for trees to reproduce each hour (default: 1–3% depending on type). Default: ×1. ×0 disables reproduction. Example: ×2 makes a Pine with a base 3% chance reproduce at 6% chance.

The following multipliers adjust planting time, growth speed, output, harvest time, and demolishing time. Set values below 1 to make plants easier; increase above 1 to make them harder except for Output Multiplier.
Examples:
- Planting Time ×0.5: Planting Oak 1 hour -> 0.5 hours
- Growth Rate ×0.5: Potato 5 days -> 2.5 days
- Output ×1.5: Carrot 3 -> 4
- Harvest Time ×0.5: Oak cutting 2 hours -> 1 hour
- Demolishing Time ×0.5: Demolish Pine 1.2 hours -> 0.6 hours

They are separated into three sections:
- Tree options: Log-providing plants planted by Foresters (e.g. Pine, Oak).
- Crop options: All other plants that are planted by Farmers or Foresters (e.g. Carrot, Blueberry and Dandelion Bushes).
- Product options: Products that grow on mature plants (e.g. Pine Resin, Blueberries). This section does not have Planting time and Demolishing time as they do not apply.

v10.1.1: Should work with Update 1.0.5 (Dec 03)
v10.1.0:
- Added Planting time, Harvest time, and Demolishing time multipliers.
- Reorganize settings into sections for better clarity.
- Internal: added an order of 100 for the modifier so it likely will run after other mods that use Moddable Timberborn like Daisugi.
