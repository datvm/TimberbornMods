LV.SPE.WaterConversation,"Water product conversion rate",
LV.SPE.WaterConversationDesc,"The conversion rate for water product vs. volume.
Game default: 0.2, meaning Water Pumps take 0.2m³ to produce 1 Water product and Water Dumps produce 0.2m³ per Water product",
LV.SPE.MechPumpWater,"Mechanical pump amount (⚡!)",
LV.SPE.MechPumpWaterDesc,"The amount of water per second that the mechanical pump pumps (Game default: 0.25m³/s).
⚡ Note: changing this also increase or decrease power usage accordingly, see below.",
LV.SPE.MechPumpWaterMul,"Mechanical pump amount multiplier (⚡!)",
LV.SPE.MechPumpWaterMulDesc,"The multiplier for the amount of water per second that the mechanical pump pumps (Game default: 1x = 0.25m³/s).
⚡ Note: changing this also increase or decrease power usage accordingly.
Note: don't increase this too much (> x2) as the pump can only take water from 1 cube anyway.",
LV.SPE.MechPumpPowerMultiplier,"Mechanical pump power multiplier",
LV.SPE.MechPumpPowerDesc,"When you increase or decrease the mechanical pump water amount, the power usage is also adjusted accordingly.
You can, however, change the power usage multiplier here to make it use more or less (cheating :P) power than the default calculation.
For example, setting Water amount to x2 while setting this to x0.5 will make the pump use the same power as default, but pump double the water.",
LV.SPE.WaterProdTimeMultiplier,"Water production time multiplier",
LV.SPE.WaterProdTimeMultiplierDesc,"The multiplier for water production time (higher is harder). Game default 1x = 0.33 hour for 1 Water for Water Pumps. Setting this to 0.5 will make it produce 1 water in 0.165 hour while setting it to 2 will make it produce 1 water in 0.66 hour.",
