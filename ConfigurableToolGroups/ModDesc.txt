Moddable Tool Groups gives full control over how tool groups are structured. It lets mods create multi-level tool groups, put the same tool/group in multiple places, and freely reorganize the tool hierarchy.

[b]Note to players:[/b]
- For some funny reason, Tutorial will not work with this mod enabled. Just enable this mod once you have finished the Tutorial.
- This mod does nothing on its own. It only provides a framework that other mods can use to add multi-level tool groups. You can pick any flavor from those mods.

For modders: see the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3612247861]More Organized Tool Groups mod[/url] for examples.

This mod provides two specs: [b]ParentToolGroupSpec[/b] and [b]ToolGroupChildrenSpec[/b]:

[code]
public record ParentToolGroupSpec : ComponentSpec
{
	[Serialize]
	public ImmutableArray<string> ParentIds { get; init; } = [];
}

public record ToolGroupChildrenSpec : ComponentSpec
{
	[Serialize]
	public ImmutableArray<string> ChildrenGroupsIds { get; init; } = [];

	[Serialize]
	public ImmutableArray<string> ChildrenToolsTemplateNames { get; init; } = [];

	[Serialize]
	public bool DoNotIncludePlaceableToolGroup { get; init; }
}
[/code]

[b]ParentToolGroupSpec[/b] can be applied to [b]BlockObjectToolGroupSpec[/b] or any block object blueprints. [b]ToolGroupChildrenSpec[/b] quickly populates a tool group with child groups and tools. Both can be combined. Duplicates are removed automatically, and cyclic groups are detected with clear error info.

[h1]Examples:[/h1]

Combine the Food and Water tool groups into a new group called Essentials in [b]Essentials.BlockObjectToolGroupSpec.blueprint.json[/b]:

[code]
{
    "BlockObjectToolGroupSpec": {
        "Id": "Essentials",
        "Order": 45,
        "NameLocKey": "LV.OG.GroupEssentials",
        "Icon": "Sprites/OrganizedGroups/Essentials",
        "FallbackGroup": false
    },
    "ToolGroupChildrenSpec": {
        "ChildrenGroupsIds": [
            "Food",
            "Water"
        ]
    }
}
[/code]

Alternatively, you can just declare the group and move items in with [b]ParentToolGroupSpec[/b]. In [b]Productions.BlockObjectToolGroupSpec.blueprint[/b], only the group is declared, and [b]BlockObjectToolGroup.Metal.blueprint.json[/b] and [b]BlockObjectToolGroup.Wood.blueprint.json[/b] move the groups into Productions:

[code]
{
    "ParentToolGroupSpec": {
        "ParentIds": [ "Productions" ]
    }
}
[/code]

[b]ParentToolGroupSpec[/b] can be applied to block object blueprints too. In [b]Platform.Folktails.blueprint.json[/b] and [b]Platform.IronTeeth.blueprint.json[/b], I add the platforms to "Path" because I think it's often used:

[code]
{
    "ParentToolGroupSpec": {
        "ParentIds": [ "Paths" ]
    }
}
[/code]

But aren't they already in "Paths" group? Well, because I also make a "Platforms" group and in its [b]ToolGroupChildrenSpec[/b], I declare the [b]Platform[/b] and with [b]DoNotIncludePlaceableToolGroup: true[/b] (so Double and Triple platforms do not appear in Paths again):

Platforms.BlockObjectToolGroupSpec.blueprint.json:
[code]
{
    "BlockObjectToolGroupSpec": {
        "Id": "Platforms",
        "Order": 10,
        "NameLocKey": "LV.OG.GroupPlatforms",
        "Icon": "Sprites/OrganizedGroups/Platforms",
        "FallbackGroup": false
    },
    "ToolGroupChildrenSpec": {
        "ChildrenToolsTemplateNames": [
            "Platform.Folktails",
            "Platform.IronTeeth",
            "DoublePlatform.Folktails",
            "DoublePlatform.IronTeeth",
            "TriplePlatform.Folktails",
            "TriplePlatform.IronTeeth"
        ],
        "DoNotIncludePlaceableToolGroup": true
    }
}
[/code]

So with the above files, Platform appears twice: once in Platforms group and once in Paths group.

The most complete example is the Surfaces group: it is inside the Paths group and it contains both many tool groups (Platforms, Bridges and Overhangs) and many tools (Metal Platform 3x3 and 5x5):

[code]
{
    "BlockObjectToolGroupSpec": {
        "Id": "Surfaces",
        "Order": 10,
        "NameLocKey": "LV.OG.GroupSurfaces",
        "Icon": "Sprites/OrganizedGroups/Surfaces",
        "FallbackGroup": false
    },
    "ParentToolGroupSpec": {
        "ParentIds": [ "Paths" ]
    },
    "ToolGroupChildrenSpec": {
        "ChildrenGroupsIds": [
            "Platforms",
            "Bridges",
            "Overhangs"
        ],
        "ChildrenToolsTemplateNames": [
            "MetalPlatform3x3.Folktails",
            "MetalPlatform3x3.IronTeeth",
            "MetalPlatform5x5.Folktails",
            "MetalPlatform5x5.IronTeeth"
        ],
        "DoNotIncludePlaceableToolGroup": true
    }
}
[/code]

v10.0.2: Fixed the tooltip sometimes saying "Tooltip" instead of the group name.
v10.0.1: Fixed a crash when a group is present at multiple places. Unfortunately I have to patch out Tutorial to fix it so just play it without Tutorial 😂.
