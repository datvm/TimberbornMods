Configurable Top Bar gives you full control over what appears in Timberborn's top-bar resource panel. You can create your own groups, reorder them, choose icons, and decide exactly which goods belong where. No more Badwater owning its own group!

From Main Menu -> Mods -> Setting button next to the mod name to customize the top bar.

Notes:
- Do not give the same ID to multiple groups or you will crash the game. See below if you accidentally do this.
- The info is stored at [i]Documents\Timberborn\TopBarConfig.json[/i] if you want to share or modify it manually. In case something messed up, just delete the file and it will be recreated with default game values.
