Configure various settings of Ziplines and Tubeways. You can change their bonus speed, ziplines' max connections, distance and inclinations. You can also remove the speed penalty (50%) and this even increases game performance as the game does not need to check for beavers if they are underwater or not.

You can also enable "Zipline through obstacles" option, orignally intended only to remove the annoyance of trees blocking the zipline cables, unfortunately to make it possible, zipline cables can be created (and beavers do travel them) through anywhere. It's your game, play it with your own rule like don't create crazy cables or just do it.

By default this mod doubles the speed bonus (+150% to +300% for ziplines, +300% to +600% for Tubeways) and ziplines' max connection (2 to 4). To configure: from Main Menu -> Mods -> Settings button next to the mod name.

Note: if you disable "Tubeway for Folktails" or "Zipline for Iron Teeth" then open a save that you have built those, they will disappear and your Beaver may get stuck. Better delete them manually before disabling those options.
