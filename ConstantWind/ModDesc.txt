Wind strength is now constant. The strength is configurable in the Mods menu and the default is at 50%. Wind direction is not affected but I think it's for your eyes only and no mechanic in the game uses it.

[strike]Note: when loading your save for the first time with this mod, you have to wait until the wind changes, randomly between 5-12 in-game hours.[/strike] With v10.0.0, the setting is applied immediately when you change it in the setting.

v10.0.0: (for V1 games only)
- Should work for Timberborn v1.0
- Settings is now a text box so you can enter any number including number higher than 100.
- Settings are now applied immediately including when changing in-game.
v7.0.0: added support to Update 7 (Update 6 players still benefit from this update). You can also change the settings while in-game now too instead of just at the Main Menu. As with the below note, when changing the settings in-game, you need to wait until the game actually changes the wind.
