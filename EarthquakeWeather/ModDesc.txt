This expansion mod for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3493039008]Moddable Weather[/url] brings you the highly requested Earthquake thanks to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3559268095]Building HP & Renovation[/url].

[h1]Earthquakes[/h1]
During Earthquake "season", quakes strike occasionally.

In a random area:
- Buildings are damaged and cluttered. Certain buildings (production, housing) will cease functioning for 0.5 days.
- All ongoing constructions are reset to 0 progress (delivered materials remain).
- All [b]Explosives[/b] are detonated instantly!
- Storage buildings (Piles, Warehouses, Tanks) lose 25–50% of their content. If any [b]explosives[/b] are inside, all content is lost and the building is destroyed.
- Beavers and Bots may be injured or damaged (Bots lose durability).

Everywhere:
- Water levels surge upward.

[h1]Configurable Settings[/h1]
In addition to the standard weather settings, you can configure:
- [b]Min & Max Strength[/b]: Damage range inflicted to buildings. Maximum damage is applied at the quake center, spreading down to minimum at the radius edge.
- [b]Surge Strength (%) [/b]: How much water rises when a quake hits.
- [b]Min & Max Frequency[/b]: How often quakes strike during a "season".
- [b]Injury Chance (%) [/b]: Chance that Beavers are injured and Bots are damaged when inside the hit area (0–100%).
- [b]Bot Durability Loss (%) [/b]: Lifetime lost by Bots when damaged. At 100%, they are destroyed immediately.

All these values can be exported and tied to the Difficulty Template.

[h1]New Renovations[/h1]
This mod introduces specialized Renovations to help buildings endure earthquakes:
- [b]Reinforced Foundations[/b]: Permanently reduces earthquake damage by 50%.
- [b]Shock-Absorbing Structure[/b]: Grants immunity to earthquake damage for the next 3 hits.
- [b]Seismic Symbiosis[/b]: When the next quake strikes, permanently increase this building’s Durability by +100%. Can only be applied once. Also grants immunity to that hit.
- [b]Reinforced Storage[/b] (Storage buildings only): Prevents stored goods from spilling during earthquakes. Also stops Explosives from destroying the building.

[i]Note:[/i] Earthquake side effects (e.g. halting production, spilling storage) are only applied if the building actually loses HP from the hit. Certain Renovations like the [b]Amberwall[/b] from the base mod can mitigate these effects. These protections do not apply to Beavers or Bots inside buildings.

[b]Beware:[/b] Even invulnerable buildings can collapse if their supporting foundations are destroyed by an earthquake. Upper structures remain dependent on the integrity of what lies beneath.

v7.0.1:
- Fixed Water Surge only expands half of what it should. Thanks @Yrankra for the report. Be aware it's doubly harder now. Also minor performance improvement.
- Fixed Shock-Absorbing Structure stay in the active list after being used so you could not apply it again. Seismic Symbiosis now stays in the active list after being active instead of being removed (visual only). Thanks @Akinare for the report.
- A few minor text changes.
- Removed dev log that should not be there in the release version.
