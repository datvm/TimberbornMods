You can now edit the difficulty settings of your save anytime! This mod adds a "Change Difficulty" option to your menu (while in game). Simply click it and you can configure the settings you normally can only set at the start of a new game.

[b]Note 1:[/b] remember to make a save before using this mod. Then after using it, make a new save and then reload the game with that new save to apply the changes.

[b]Note 2:[/b] weather change is only applied in the next season because the game already decides the weather for current season when it started.

You don't need to keep this mod on after you have changed and saved the new setting.
