Builders can reach higher or challenge yourself by not letting them build inifinitely lower. Configurable. Note that by default, this mod does not change the game default behavior!

To configure, go to the Mod Settings (Main Menu -> Mods -> Settings button next to the mod name):

- Unlimited Above and Unlimited Below: let them build no matter how higher or lower the building is (see the 2nd screenshot).
- Use slider to set how high or low they should be able to reach. For example the 3rd screenshot is how they can reach with both settings set to 2 (they can build 2 tiles above and 2 tiles below themselves).

- Extend Demolision Range: Allow extending demolision range with the same settings as building range. That means you can now demolish (remove plants) things above or below the builders.
