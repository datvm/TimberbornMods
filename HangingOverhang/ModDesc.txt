This mod adds Hanging Overhang.

[i]"Living on the edge? I prefer building on it." — Brin[/i]

- Functions like a normal Overhang but can be attached directly to terrain.
- Solid (other buildings can be built on its top).
- Cost 700 Science to unlock, 10 Planks, 10 Treated Planks, and 4 Metal Blocks to build.

Physics law decrees that only the 2x1 Overhang is available.

Can be built by both the Folktails and Iron Teeths. GreedyBuilders and Emberpelts are supported but not tested, please tell me if it does not work.
