With this mod you can now select and manage multiple buildings at the same time! It even comes with useful utilities like Copying and selecting all buildings with filters.

All hotkeys are rebindable in the settings menu (Settings -> Keybindings -> UI group).

[h1]Selecting multiple buildings[/h1]

You can select multiple buildings of the same kind (Lumbermills, Large Tanks, etc.) by:

- Holding Shift (or whichever you bind the "Alternate Action" key) and clicking on a building. Shift clicking a selected building to unselect it.
- Select a building then click Select All (Ctrl + A) or Select in District (Ctrl + Shift + A), Pick an Area (Alt + A) then click and drag to select buildings in the area.

While one or more buildings is selected, you can also click Copy (Ctrl + C or Ctrl + Insert) to quickly select the Build tool to build the same type of building.

[h1]Macro Management[/h1]

With multiple buildings selected, you can then also uncheck or check to decide which buildings to be affected. You can see quick info of them including their names, the status (Pause/Running), the Storage's type, the Dwellings' number of beavers.

You can (when applicable):
- Pause/Unpause.
- Set the Storage's type or remove it.
- Set Workplace's settings: Workers, Priority and Type.
- Set the Production's recipe.
- Delete all selected ones (with Delete key).
