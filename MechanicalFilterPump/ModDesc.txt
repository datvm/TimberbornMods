Your Mechanical Fluid Pump can now purify Badwater into fresh water at the cost of double the power usage. You can enable this filter on each pump individually.

Don't like the power cost? [spoiler]You can enable Dev Mode (Alt + Shift + Z) and a checkbox would appear to let you disable the power increment. But you are a cheater![/spoiler]
