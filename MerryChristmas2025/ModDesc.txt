Merry Christmas and Happy New Year 2025! It's time for gifts!

Merry Christmas 2025 is a small, fun holiday mod that brings festive cheer to your colony. It replaces the Dynamite explosion sound with a fun sound effect and leaves behind random gifts after each blast, so every detonation is a present in disguise.
