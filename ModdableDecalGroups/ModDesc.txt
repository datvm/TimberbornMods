The author of Alphabet Banners requested a mod to organize decals into groups for easier access. This mod provides that functionality by categorizing decals into predefined groups based on their themes and styles.

It works for both Banners and Tails (called Decals by the game).

I highly recommend using [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3472334132]TImprove 4 UI[/url] for the scrollbar if the list gets too long.
