[b]Note to players: This mod does nothing on its own. It only provides a framework that other mods can use.[/b]

This mod is a complete rewrite of Moddable and Unlockable Recipes. This is for Timberborn V1 only.

[h1]Features:[/h1]
- Lock or unlock recipes at any time. You can also customize how the locked recipes are displayed.
- Modify recipe, including ingredients or products or any of the RecipeSpec properties at any time.
- With this mod active, you can also have multiple recipes in the same building with the same good in both ingredients and products.
- With v10.0, the UI is no longer clunky like v7.
