[b]For end-user, you won't see any in-game changes from this mod. This mod is a shared library for other mods to use.[/b]

ModdableTimberborn provides a shared API layer for Timberborn modding. It offers quick access to reusable features that can support multiple mods, expanding on TimberUI with gameplay-level functionality.

This mod replaces earlier projects (Buff & Debuff and Moddable Bindito). Existing mods that depended on those will transition to this unified system.

Includes full source code and a demo project showing how to use the various APIs, such as:
- Bonus System: easily track and update bonus stats.
- Enterable and WorkSystem: Event based systems for buildings and workers.
- MechanicalSystem: sharable modifiers for powers.
- Entity Describers: unified UI to show certain statuses.
