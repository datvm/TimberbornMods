Moddable Timberborn Achievements gives Timberborn a full, moddable achievement system that works on every platform, even without Steam.

[h1]Features[/h1]

- Brings the full set of Steam achievements to non-Steam players (and still unlocks Steam achievements in parallel if you are on Steam).
- Adds new pop-up notifications for achievement unlocks (for both Steam and non-Steam players).
- Automatically unlocks any Steam achievements you earned before installing the mod when you first load a save.
- Provides a dedicated Achievements dialog, accessible from both the Main Menu and the in-game menu.

Note:
- Your achievement unlocks is stored in [i]Documents/Timberborn/PlayerData[/i], which is also synced by Steam Cloud.
- You can also open the Achievements dialog using the default hotkey [b]P[/b] (configurable in the Key Bindings menu in the UI section).

[h1]For Modders[/h1]

This mod lets you create and register your own achievements with custom names, icons, descriptions, and secret flags.
See the Demo project ([url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3613175358]Steam Page[/url]) for example and a step-by-step guide on how to create achievements in your own mods.

Obviously, custom achievements do not sync with Steam achievements since those are defined by the developers.
