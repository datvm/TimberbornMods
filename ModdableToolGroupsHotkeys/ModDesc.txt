Moddable Tool Groups Hotkeys adds configurable hotkey support for Moddable Tool Groups, allowing quick access to tools, tool groups, plantings, and buildings. In addition to the built-in hotkeys, other mods can register their own hotkeys for custom tools.

- Hotkeys for all tools, including grouped tools such as Plant Crops and Demolish.
- Separate hotkey groups for plantings (crops and trees).
- Hotkeys for all buildings, including opening building groups.

Notes
- Keybindings can only be configured in-game or in the Map Editor (Esc -> Keybindings).
- The keybindings list shows only tools and buildings available in the current game, but bindings are saved and persist across faction changes.
- Some buildings differ between factions internally (for example, Folktails vs Iron Teeth Campfire) and require separate bindings, while others are shared (such as Paths or Oak).
