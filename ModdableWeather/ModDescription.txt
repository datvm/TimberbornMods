An overhaul for the Weather system in Timberborn! This mod adds a flexible weather system that lets modders easily create new weather types. Meanwhile, you as a player can easily choose and configure your weather settings as well!

[h1]Brand new weathers![/h1]

Come with this mods is a set of new weather types that can be configured in the mod settings, including the three original weathers from the game. You can choose to enable or disable any of them, and even change their durations and probabilities.

[i]Note: By default the new weathers are disabled.[/i] You can configure them in the [b]Main Menu > Mods > Settings[/b] button next to the mod name.

[b]Tip:[/b] Use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3468642084]TImprove 4 Mods[/url] to make the setting box taller.

[list]
[*][b]Rain[/b] (Temperate)
Shorter than a typical temperate season. Great for crops and also come with fancy effect!
Effect: All tiles are watered and no land contamination occurs. Rain also applies to Wet Fur when Beavers are not in the buildings. 25% shorter than the usual temperate reason (configurable).
Note: if you encounter performance issues, you can disable the rain effect in the mod settings.

[*][b]Disappointingly Short Temperate[/b] (Temperate)
An extremely brief temperate period, showing up only after cycle 10. Sandwiched between two hazardous weather - a real test of your colony's recovery skills!
Effect: a very short Temperate season so you will need to deal with two hazardous seasons in a row.

[*][b]Progressively Shortening Temperate[/b] (Temperate)
This weather is intended to be the replacement for the original temperate weather, where the duration of the temperate season progressively shortens over time. It starts with a full temperate season, but with each cycle, it gets shorter. You should disable the original temperate weather if you want to use this one.
Effect: a Temperate season that starts like the game's normal one but it gets shorter and shorter.

[*][b]Monsoon[/b] (Hazardous)
All water sources surge, increasing their output to up to 350% (handicap applies). Expect major floods - try to stay afloat or get liquidated!
Effect: All water sources increase their output, at 350% (or configurable) maximum.

[*][b]Surprisingly Refreshing[/b] ("Hazardous")
Feeling under the weather? This rare, pleasant though short surprise lets all water sources provide perfectly fresh water (no contamination), even from the dirtiest sources. Enjoy it while it lasts!
Effect: No bad effect. All water sources produce fresh water.
[/list]

[h1]Settings[/h1]

[b]Note: These settings override the setting you set when starting the game (difficulty). Please change these settings instead[/b].

For each weather type, you can configure the following settings:
[list]
[*][b]Enabled[/b]: Toggle the weather on or off.
[*][b]Start cycle[/b]: The cycle when this weather can start to occur. For example, if you set it to 10, the weather will not appear before cycle 10.
[*][b]Chance[/b]: The chance of this weather occurring in a cycle. This is not exactly a percentage since there are multiple weathers "fighting" for the same cycle, it's actually a weight. For example, if you set Temperate to 100 and Rain to 50, then Temperate has twice the chance of occurring than Rain (66.67% vs 33.33%).
[*][b]Min/Max Days[/b]: How many days this weather can last. Handicap applied (see below).
[*][b]Handicap[/b]: Defined by Handicap Percentage and Handicap Cycles. At the first time this weather occurs, the days are multiplied by the Handicap Percentage. It could be < 100% to make the weather last shorter, or > 100% to make it last longer. The percentage moves towards 100% every cycle, and after the Handicap Cycles it will be 100%. For example, Progressively Shortening Temperate uses this to start with a full temperate season and then shorten it every cycle.
[/list]

On some weathers, difficulty is also provided as a template (they are just convenient buttons to set numbers to certain values). Most of them in this mod are pulled from the game's default. Due to technical limitation, right now clicking a button jumps the scroll to top.

You can also Export and Import setting profiles by clicking the buttons on the top.

[h1]Single Weather mode[/h1]

In this mode, each cycle will only have one kind of weather: Temperate or Hazardous. This blurs the difference between the two weather types.

You can enable this mode in the Settings:

- Enable Single Weather mode: Each cycle may have a chance to only have one kind of weather.
- Single Weather start cycle: The minimum cycle that single weather can occur.
- Single Weather chance: The chance of single weather occurring.
- Single Weather Temperate chance: When single weather occurs, this is the chance that it will be Temperate weather (else, it will be Hazardous weather).

Note:
- Your weather forecast won't work when Single weather occurs.
- You can set any chance to 100% if you are up for a challenge.
- Weather types are still chosen normally between all enabled types.

[h1]For modders:[/h1]

You can check the documentation (placeholder, docs incoming) or the mod's source code to see how to create your own weather types. The project source is [url=https://github.com/datvm/TimberbornMods/tree/master/ModdableWeather]on GitHub[/url]. Check out the [b]Weathers[/b] folder and [b]Blueprints\ModdedWeatherSpec[/b] for the details.

[h1]Troubleshooting[/h1]

Please disable this mod to use Map Editor. It is not compatible with it.

If your game crashes, please check the log and see if it contains "IgorZ.Automation" (Automation mod) or "Jeferson90.ProgressiveDifficulty" (Progressive difficulty mod). Those mods are not compatible for now. Automation mod has a fix on Discord apparently but not updated on Steam.

If you need any help or feedback, you can leave a comment or Discord: https://discord.com/channels/558398674389172225/1379728375396040806
