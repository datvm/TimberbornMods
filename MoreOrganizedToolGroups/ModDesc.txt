Powered by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3612110827]Moddable Tool Groups[/url], this mod reorganizes the tool groups in [i]my[/i] preferred way.

[h2]Design philosophy[/h2]
- Modded buildings (except mine!) are not supported. More Groups will be more suitable for that.
- Groups as many groups and tools as possible together to make the toolbar more compact. You may lose more time opening more levels though.
- Common tools are placed in multiple places that make sense, especially the Storage buildings: Platform is present in both Paths and its own group, storage groups (Piles, Warehouses and Tanks) are present in both Storage and relevant material production (I myself keep looking for Tanks in Water for example).
