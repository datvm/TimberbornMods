With Update 1, Copy function has greatly improved your settlement building experience. However, try this Power Copy mod for even more powerful capabilities!

With Power Copy you can:
- Choose [b]what[/b] to copy, like Pause status only.

- Choose [b]where[/b] to copy to:
[list]
[*]Only the same building type or all buildings with compatible components.
[*]In the whole settlement, the same district or even [b]select an area[/b]!
[*]Or the super fancy advanced dialog to pick the exact buildings you want to copy to!
[/list]

Use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3472334132]TImprove 4 UI[/url] for the scrollbar and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3547764728]TImprove 4 UX[/url] for the collapsible panel if the list gets too long.

Note: the mod still uses the game's built-in copy logic so certain options are not copied even though it says it can. For example, the game code only copy the Worker number IF the buildings have the same number of Max worker capacity.
