Add a useful Quick Bar to your game with this expansion mod for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3481116192]Omni Bar & Todo List[/url]!

20 slots are available with customizable hotkeys. The default hotkeys are Numpad 0 to 9, you can edit or add more in Settings -> Keybindings. Please note not to use Shift in the hotkey because the mod uses Shift + Hotkey for assigning items to the hotbar.

You can assign these items to the Quick Bar using [b]Shift + Hotkey[/b]:
- [b]Tools[/b] from the Omnibar search: so you can assign building tool to a hotkey.
- Any named entity (buildings, beavers, plants etc) that can be searched with "/find" command.
- Select any entity in the world and use [b]Shift + Hotkey[/b] to assign it to the Quick Bar without Omnibar.

You can also collapse the Quick Bar to save space. You can still use the hotkeys. The mod also let you change between two locations (horizontal or vertical).

Note:
- The tools are stored in your save so it's not carried over to a new game.
