Tired of rubble piles cluttering your colony? Nothing's more frustrating than those scraps lying around forever. Mod idea by [b]zohan_zzgamer[/b].

This mod adds a single button: "Clean up all Rubbles NOW!"
Click it, and every piece of rubble will be gathered and distributed into available storages across the map.

If you do not have enough storage to keep everything, the mod also gives you an option to [b]discard[/b] (WARNING: meaning, lost forever) the remaining.

Finally, a clean slate. [b]No rubble left behind![/b]

Note: Materials are automatically distributed into all storage buildings, no matter the districts of the rubble or storage. Likely in the order that you built the storage buildings.
