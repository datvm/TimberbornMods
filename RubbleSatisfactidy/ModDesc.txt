Tired of rubble piles cluttering your colony? Nothing's more frustrating than those scraps lying around forever. Mod idea by [b]zohan_zzgamer[/b].

This mod adds a single button: "Clean up all Rubbles NOW!"
Click it, and every piece of rubble will be gathered and distributed into available storages across the map.

Finally, a clean slate. [b]No rubble left behind![/b]
