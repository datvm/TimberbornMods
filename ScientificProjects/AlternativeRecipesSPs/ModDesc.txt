Mod source code and donation: https://github.com/datvm/TimberbornMods (feel free to use the code for anything).

v10.0.0:
- Updated for Timberborn v1.0 and Scientific Projects 10.0.
- Now depends on Moddable Recipes.
- Crude Log Press Extract and Water Filter have been moved back to Gear Workshop and Centrifuge.
- Science costs have been increased to adjust for 'inflation'.

v7.4.0: See Scientific Projects 7.4.0 update. This update also apply recipe changes to both Folktails and Iron Teeth so Greedy Builders can get those recipes in their buildings as well. The catch is that some recipes now show up in both factions and some cannot be unlocked.
v7.2.2: Recipe names are now separate and more generic. This update is just a text change and no function is changed.
v7.2.1: Should work with April 10 update now.
v7.1.1:
I was made aware of an issue where a building cannot have a Good (like Water) as both an Ingredient and a Product, which causes Hauler to keep putting the goods in and out indefinitely. I have to move a few recipes around to fix this.

- Crude Log Press Extract (Iron Teeth only) is now in the Lumbermill instead of Gear Workshop (because it was using Gear as an ingredient).
- Water Filter is now in the Dirt Extractor instead of the Centrifuge (because it was using Water as an ingredient/product).

Please also update the Moddable & Unlockable Recipes to v7.1.3

v7.1.0: Greedy Builders can now use the faction-specific projects.
