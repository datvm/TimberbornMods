This is an expansion mod for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3442389397]Scientific Projects[/url] that add Power-related projects to the game.

[h1]Water Wheel[/h1]
These upgrades apply to all Water Wheels in the game (Small, Regular, and Large).

- Gentle Mist Flow / Steady Mist Surge: Gradually increases power output throughout the day.  
- Concentrated Mist Dynamo: Permanently boosts power output all day.
- Thermal Flow Stabilizer: Ensures minimum power output even with no current as long as there is water.
- Steam-Charged Boost: Further increases the minimum power output.

[h1]Power Wheels[/h1]
These upgrades apply to all Power Wheels in the game (Folktails and Iron Teeth).
- Gearshift Labor Sync (Iron Teeth only): Reduces the number of workers for Large Power Wheels.
- Bot-Integrated Axles: Enables Bots to operate Power Wheels.

[h1]Windmill[/h1]
These upgrades are for Folktails and apply to all Windmills in the game (Regular and Large).
- High-Altitude Gust Harness: Boosts Windmill power based on height (count at the top of the Windmill).
- Compact Wind Sails: Windmills now only occupy 1x1 instead of a 3x3 area (meaning you can build them right next to each other).

[h1]Surplus Power[/h1]
- Power Flux Thinkatron: Converts unused power into science points. Batteries are not affected (it can still accumulate storage as usual) and do not affect any calculation of this project.

Note: a few of the upgrades have "[Reload needed]" tags which means after purchasing, you need to make a save, then just load that save again to take effect. There will be a message box showing when purchasing to remind you.
