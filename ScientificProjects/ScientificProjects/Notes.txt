This Timberborn mod gives you the Scientific Projects dialog, accessible via the top-left Science button or a rebindable hotkey (default Y). Choose between one-time and daily-cost projects to shape your colony's future.

- Only science is required to pay for a project.
- One time projects are paid once and unlocked forever. There is no negative to them because they are permanent.
- Daily-cost projects are paid daily and can be adjusted any time. The lump sum is paid at the start of the day, and that effect is active for 24 hours. These projects don't need to be unlocked but are usually locked behind another one-time project.

Each project is typically defined like this:

- Texts:
```csv
LV.SP.WorkEffUpgrade2,"Precision Tool Maintenance",
LV.SP.WorkEffUpgrade2Lore,"'Rigged a water-powered sharpener-keeps our tools gnaw-ready, speeds up every job over time!' â€” Chiseljaw Timberchew",
LV.SP.WorkEffUpgrade2Eff,"{0:+#%} additional work efficiency of all beavers per Level.",
LV.SP.WorkEffUpgrade2Cost,"[Cost] per Level, and {1} for every {2} Adult beavers (rounded up)",
```

- Game Specs:
