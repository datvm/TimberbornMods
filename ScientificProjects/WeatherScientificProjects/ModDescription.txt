This is an expansion mod for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3442389397]Scientific Projects[/url] that add weather-related projects to the game. This mod requires [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3630523180]Moddable Weathers[/url] for V1 or [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3493039008]Moddable Weather[/url] (for U7).

[h1]Weather warning extension:[/h1]
- Galesniffer's Totem: Warnings of the next weather come +1 day earlier.
- Mistweaver's Dial: Warnings of the next weather come +1 day earlier.
- Thunderhub's Spire (daily project): Warnings of the next weather come +1 day earlier per Level.

[h1]Hazardous weather prediction:[/h1]

- Weather Forecasting: Predict the next stage's weather. The accuracy starts at 20% at the first day and increases by 5% every day.
For example, in the screenshot it says "75% drought, lasts 5-11d" meaning the prediction accuracy is 75% (very likely it will be drought), and the drought will last anywhere between 5-11 days. The day range also gets narrower as the prediction accuracy increases.
- Starlit Precision: Weather Forecasting now starts with additional 20% accuracy on the first day of the cycle (to 40%).
- Hydrological Analysis (daily project): Add 1% accuracy per Level to Weather Forecasting everyday, up to 10% a day.

[h1]Water source Strength:[/h1]

These projects let you increase or decrease the water source strength. You need to unlock a one-time project to access the ongoing projects separately for fresh and bad water source:

- Flowmaster's Conduit: Allow you to increase the strength of Water sources, up to +200%.
- Tidebreaker's Gate: Allow you to decrease the strength of Water sources, up to -80%.

[h1]Emergencies Drilling:[/h1]
- 3 Emergency Drills projects: Add some days to this benign season by drilling a recently discovered shallow water source (just flavor text, no water source on the map is actually affected). Can only be activated when hazardous weather is coming.

[h1]Changes in v10.0:[/h1]
- There is no longer a hard separate between benign and hazardous weather types since a cycle may now contain any combinations of weather types.
- Emergencies Drilling projects now need a save reload to take effect. Please make a save as soon as you buy the project to avoid undefined behavior.
