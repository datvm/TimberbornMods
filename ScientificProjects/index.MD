The [Scientific Projects](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3442389397) and its extension mods can be expanded with or without code.

- [Code-less guide](./codeless) (JSON mods): You do not need any C# code. You can mostly modify project's parameters but not adding new ones.
- [C# modding guide](./coding.MD): You can add or modify other projects. This is how extension mods are made including the ones I released.
