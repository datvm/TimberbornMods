LV.MWSb.SkyblightStrengthDesc,"How fast the blight spreads into the water (%/tick).
Each game tick (0.6s), a part of water is made into badwater.
For example, at default 0.1%, your reservoir without any new fresh water in
will become 100% contaminated after 1000 ticks / 600s (about one and a half game day).",

LV.MWSb.Update704,"The Skyblight Strength setting unit is now % instead of â€°.
You can also set it to smaller number by using decimal.
The default value is set to 0.1% (5 times slower than previous default settings).",
LV.MWSb.SkyblightDesc,"Hazardous weather: All water get contaminated over time. Does not affect waters in storage (Tanks).",
LV.MWSb.BadrainDesc,"Hazardous weather: Same effect as Skyblight and selectable additional effects:
- Limit Moisture Range: your land can only carry moisture to a much smaller range.
- Contaminate Land: the land will be contaminated every now and then.",
