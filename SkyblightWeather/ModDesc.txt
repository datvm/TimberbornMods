When the skies themselves conspire, no dam can save you. This expansion mod for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3493039008]Moddable Weather[/url] introduces two new hazardous weather types:

[h1]Skyblight[/h1]

Think you're safe with your massive reservoir that withstands the worst droughts? Now the air itself will turn against you: toxic pollen will slowly contaminate all water, bypassing traditional defenses.

  * Water in storages is safe, as beavers can cover them.
  * Running water is generally safer, but it becomes contaminated the farther it gets from the source.
  * Default setting: starts at cycle 7, with stats similar to Badtide but at half the chance of occurrence.
  * You can adjust the [b]strength[/b] of the pollution (%/game tick): Each game tick (0.6s), a part of water is made into badwater. For example, at default 0.1%, your reservoir without any new fresh water in will become 100% contaminated after 1000 ticks / 600s (about one and a half game day).

[h1]Badrain[/h1]
If Skyblight isn't challenging enough, enable Badrain. It's the same as Skyblight with additional challenges:
  * Limit Moisture Range: your land can only carry moisture to a much smaller range. Default: On at 3 (game default 16).
  * Contaminate Land: the land will be contaminated every now and then. Default: Off. You should tweak around the number a lot.
  * Default: starts at cycle 10, a quarter of the chance of Badtide for happening.
  * It uses the same Skyblight's Strength setting.

v7.0.5: Should work with Sep 17th update.
v7.0.4: The Skyblight Strength setting unit is now % instead of ‰. You can also set it to smaller number by using decimal. The default value is set to 0.1% (5 times slower than previous default settings).
v7.0.3: Fixed Limit Moisture sometimes does not work as intended. Thanks Akinare for helping identifying the problem.
v7.0.2: You can now choose effects of Badrain (Limit Moisture and/or Contaminate Land). Default settings are the same as before so you should not be affected without changing settings.
v7.0.1: Updated Badrain effect. Badrain is now enabled by default in the settings.
