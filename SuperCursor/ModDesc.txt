Press Shift to empower your often-forgotten Cursor tool! Extra useful info shows up when holding Shift (or a customizable hotkey) with your Cursor tool.

Current options:

- Coordinates: Height and (X, Y).
- Soil (if available): Moisture and contamination.
- Water (if available): Depth (and depth to the current object if you are pointing to a Platform for example), current and contamination.

The following info shows up if your cursor is pointing to a certain object:
- Name
- Character (Beavers and bots): Age and their growth/durability.
- Construction Site: priority, the building and material progress.
- "Cuttable" (Plants and Trees): their growth, yields and water status.
- Houses: how many are in there.
- Power: The input/output and the network total.
- Stockpile (piles, storehouses and tanks): what is stored and how many.
- Water Source (both fresh and badwater): strength and contamination.
- Workplace: priority, workers.

Priority (for builders and workplaces) are represented by these symbols: -- / - / ~ / + / ++

You can also use Keybinding options (Settings -> Keybindings -> Super Cursor) to change from the Shift key if you like. It should be in the User Interface group.

Please feel free to suggest any info it should show and I will see if I can add anything more.
