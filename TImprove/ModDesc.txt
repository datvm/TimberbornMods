TImprove enhances your Timberborn experience by providing various quality-of-life improvements. These tweaks aim to provide a more seamless and customizable gameplay experience. Below are the features, you can see the screenshots for demonstration (apparently Steam Workshop is limiting my screenshots, you can check the full version at https://imgur.com/a/aE3f2d9 ). [b]By default, only "Show game time" and "Enable 30x speed" are enabled, you need to check the options in the Mod Settings to enable them[/b], including those with shortcut (for example, the Quick Quit [Ctrl + Shift + Q] shortcut won't work until you check the option).

You can change the settings anytime: from the main menu or in-game menu, click Mods then click the gear icon next to TImprove.

v7.5.0:
- [b]Lock free camera angle[/b]: When free camera is on, the vertical angle is still locked. This option is indepedent of the "Enable free camera" option, it also applies if you enable free camera through the Dev Mode.
- [b]Use 24-hour format[/b]: Use 24-hour format for the real-time clock (17:30 instead of 05:30).

v7.4.0:
[b]Clear dead stumps[/b]: Automatically clear dead stumps or bushes (those that you could have destroyed immediately by building over):
- No: do not clear anything
- Tool: when using Demolishing Tool
- Auto: just clear them right when they appear

[b]On new day[/b]: You can choose to Pause or change to Speed 1 on a new day: everyday, on hazardous weather warning days, on hazardous weather begin days, on a new cycle day.

v7.3.0: 
- Add "Disable shadow rotation" option: Shadow does not move with time anymore.

v7.2.0: add real-time clock support for both U6 and U7. U6 [b]no longer[/b] needs TimberApi.
- Add real-time clock: Add a real-time clock in the top right corner. This is useful for players who want to keep track of the time while playing.

v7.1.0:
- Update 7 now can use Show Coordinates/Height. You do [b]NOT[/b] need TimberApi for U7 anymore.
v7.0.0:
- Update 7 should be able to use this mod now. Show Coordinates/Height is the only option that is not available for U7 yet.

v1.3.0:
- Bigger build drag area (!): Increase the build drag area for buildings like Dams (default 10x10) or Roads (25). This significantly increases the load time and memory usage so use it with caution. Example: setting this to 5 will make the drag area 15x15 Dams or 30 Roads. Can only be changed at the Main Menu.

===
v1.2.0:
- Show coordinates: Show the block coordinates (X, Y, Z) in the top right corner. Z is the height. Since (X, Y) coordinates are probably only useful for modders and map creators, the sub-option "Only show the height" is checked by default, and only show "Height: Z". Works in Map Editor as well.
===
v1.1.0:
- Prioritize rubbles: Automatically set rubbles' priority to High so your builder will likely prioritize them over normal buildings
===
v1.0.0:
- Enable free camera: Remove the camera restrictions in the game.
- Disable fog: Remove the fog in the game.

- No day light change: Visual/UI only. A selected daylight option (sunrise, day, sunset or night) will stay all the time instead of changing during the day. Probably not compatible with the 24h daylight mod.
- Show game time: Show the current game time in the top right corner. If you disable it midgame, it will disappear on the next day.
- Enable 0.25x, 30x and 99x speed: Unlock the 0.25x, 30x and 99x speed options in the game that normally only available in Dev mode. The hotkeys are: Shift + 1, 4 and 5. Be warned that this speed is unstable and may cause issues with the game. Somebody said beavers may stay hungry and thirsty.
- Quick/Force Quit [Ctrl + Shift + Q] (!): Force exit the game immediately by killing the game process. NO SAVE or game state clean up. Be careful! This option is available everywhere including at the menu and map editor.
