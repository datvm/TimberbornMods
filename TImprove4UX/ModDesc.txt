Another mod for your [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3472577005]TImprove[/url] collection to enhance the user experience with additional features and improvements.

[h1]Features[/h1]

- [b]Undo building[/b]: Quickly remove the most recent building actions you placed. If any of the buildings is already in progress or completed, a confirmation dialog will appear to confirm the undo action. You can choose how many actions you can undo in the settings, default 5. Default hotkey: Ctrl + Z.
- [b]Shift to Delete[/b]: While in any building tool, hold Shift to delete matching buildings in an area instead. You can optionally select 'Delete all kinds of buildings' to remove all types of buildings. Default hotkey: Shift ([b]note[/b] this one is in the UI group, called Alternate button action).
- [b]Recent tool[/b]: Quickly switch to the most recently used tool. Default hotkey: Ctrl + Shift + Mouse Scroll.
- [b]Collapsible entity panels[/b]: Make the entity panels (the info panels to the right when you select a building) collapsible. The expand/collapse state is stored with your game save or you can check "Global collapse state" to save it globally.

- [b]Show Dynamite destruction[/b]: Show the terrain and buildings that would be destroyed when selecting a Dynamite. If you have Multi-directional Dynamite mod enabled, this option is not needed and that mod would enable this option always.

- [b]Warning about idle workers[/b]: Add a warning when a worker has no work to do at a workplace. You can disable it for each workplace type separately or disable the entire option in the Mod Settings.

All hotkeys can be changed in the game Settings -> Keybindings. It's in the mod's own "TImprove 4 UX" hotkey group.

[h1]Known Issue[/h1]

[strike]- [b]Shift to Delete[/b] is a bit finicky because it does not re-select the building tool after you release Shift. Unfortunately the game crashes if I try to do it automatically so you will need to manually click the building tool again after pressing Shift. You can also use the [b]Recent tool[/b] hotkey to quickly switch back to the last used building tool.[/strike] Fixed in v7.0.1, if you encounter any crash please tell me.
