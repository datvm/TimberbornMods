Another mod for your [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3472577005]TImprove[/url] collection to enhance the user experience with additional features and improvements.

[h1]Features[/h1]

- [b]Undo building[/b]: Quickly remove the most recent building you placed. If the building is already in progress or completed, a confirmation dialog will appear to confirm the undo action. Default hotkey: Ctrl + Z.
- [b]Shift to Delete[/b]: While in any building tool, hold Shift to delete matching buildings in an area instead. You can optionally select 'Delete all kinds of buildings' to remove all types of buildings. Default hotkey: Shift ([b]note[/b] this one is in the UI group, called Alternate button action).
- [b]Recent tool[/b]: Quickly switch to the most recently used tool. Default hotkey: Ctrl + Shift + Mouse Scroll.

All hotkeys can be changed in the game Settings -> Keybindings. It's in the mod's own "TImprove 4 UX" hotkey group.

[h1]Known Issue[/h1]

- [b]Shift to Delete[/b] is a bit finicky because it does not re-select the building tool after you release Shift. Unfortunately the game crashes if I try to do it automatically so you will need to manually click the building tool again after pressing Shift. You can also use the [b]Recent tool[/b] hotkey to quickly switch back to the last used building tool.
