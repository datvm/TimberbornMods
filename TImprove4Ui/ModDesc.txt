This mod focuses on the UI/UX aspect of the game with many features requested by the community.

The only feature the is enabled by default is [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3468993863]Scrollable Entity Panel[/url] which will replace that mod.

Note: you can see the features in the screenshots.
