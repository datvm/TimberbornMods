[b]Note to players: This mod is a dependency for other mods. It does nothing on its own.[/b]

This mod provides [b]Transparent Shaders[/b] for other mods to use:
- [b]EnvironmentTransparentURP[/b] - for game objects and buildings.
- [b]TerrainTransparentURP[/b] - for the game's terrain (used by my Transparent Terrain mod).
- [b]PlainColorTransparentURP[/b] and [b]UnlitPlainColorTransparentURP[/b] - for simple, untextured, plain-color objects for various purposes.

Example usage can be seen in my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3603735817]Transparent Terrain[/url] mod ([url=])

It also includes a built-in helper service, [b]TransparentShaderService[/b], injected in the Bootstrapper context.

- Use properties such as [b]TransparentShaderService.TransparentEnvironmentShader[/b] or [b]TransparentShaderService.TerrainTransparentShader[/b] to access the desired shaders.
- Helper methods like [b]ReplaceShaders, ReplaceRenderersMaterials, RestoreShaders, and RestoreRenderersMaterials[/b] are provided to quickly switch between shader variants (for example, EnvironmentURP ↔ EnvironmentTransparentURP). Note: Restore* methods only work after at least one replacement has been performed.

All alpha channels are independent of the color channel. The shader properties are: [b]_EnvironmentAlpha, _TerrainAlpha, and _ColorAlpha[/b].

These are defined in TransparentShaderService as follows:
[code]
public static int ShaderEnvironmentAlphaId = Shader.PropertyToID("_EnvironmentAlpha");
public static int ShaderTerrainAlphaId = Shader.PropertyToID("_TerrainAlpha");
public static int ShaderColorAlphaId = Shader.PropertyToID("_ColorAlpha");
public static int ShaderColorId = Shader.PropertyToID("_Color");
[/code]

You can also use the provided extension methods for [b]Material[/b]:
[code]
myMaterial.SetEnvironmentAlpha(0.5f);
[/code]
