This mod lets you silence specific building warnings for a building, its entire building type, or globally. Those pesky warning signs will no longer bug you when you intentionally build something questionable, like a cheap bridge somehow.

It can also be applied to Beavers and Bots, which is useful when a particular beaver is assigned to an 'interesting' district.

You can also check "Hide warnings in corner" to exclude any hidden warnings from the warning counter in the bottom-left corner of the screen. The option is shared across all entities.

All selections are stored in your save file.
